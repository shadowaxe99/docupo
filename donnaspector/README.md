# Project Documentation

Welcome to our hilarious and mind-blowing project!

## Introduction

This project is a collaboration between the brilliant Pepper Potts from "Iron Man" and the witty Donna Paulsen from "Suits". Together, we have created a solution that will make you LOL and blow your mind at the same time!

## Installation

To get started with this epic project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and put on your superhero cape. If you don't have a superhero cape, a regular cape will do just fine.
2. Navigate to the project directory like a boss. You can use your superpowers or good old-fashioned command line skills.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`. Don't worry, it won't take as long as Tony Stark's morning routine.

## Usage

To witness the awesomeness of this project, execute the following command:

```shell
node index.js
```

This will unleash the power of our server and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Get ready to ROFL!
